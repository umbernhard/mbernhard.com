  abstract:
    |
    The HTTPS certificate ecosystem has been of great interest to the measurement
    and security communities. Without any ground truth, researchers have attempted
    to study this PKI from a variety of fragmented perspectives, including passively
    monitored networks, scans of the popular domains or the IPv4 address space,
    search engines such as Censys, and Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. In this
    work, we comparatively analyze all these perspectives. We find that aggregated
    CT logs and Censys snapshots have many properties that complement each other,
    and that together they encompass over 99% of all certificates found by any of
    these techniques. However, they still miss 1.5% of certificates observed in a
    crawl of all domains in .com, .net, and .org. We go on to illustrate how this
    combined perspective affects results from previous studies. In light of these
    findings, we have worked with the operators of Censys to incorporate CT log
    data into its results going forward, and we recommend that future HTTPS
    measurement adopt this new vantage.
